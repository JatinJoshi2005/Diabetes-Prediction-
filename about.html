                        <p>
                            The Diabetes Predictor is a web application that uses machine learning to estimate the risk of diabetes based on several health metrics. It uses a Random Forest classifier trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
                        </p>

                        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The application collects health information through a form, processes this data using a pre-trained machine learning model, and provides a prediction about the risk of diabetes. The model considers factors such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and other health indicators that are known to be associated with diabetes risk.
